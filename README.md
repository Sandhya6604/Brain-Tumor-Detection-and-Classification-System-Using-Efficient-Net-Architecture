# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification-System-Using-Efficient-Net-Architecture
This project uses the EfficientNet B0 model to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans into glioma, meningioma, pituitary, or no tumor. It achieves high accuracy and demonstrates skills in medical image processing, transfer learning, and deep learning in healthcare.
